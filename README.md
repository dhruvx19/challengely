## 🧠 State Management

We use **Provider** for clean, reactive, and maintainable state management.

| Controller              | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OnboardingController`  | Manages onboarding progress, stores preferences                     |
| `ChallengeController`   | Filters challenges, tracks completion, refreshes daily challenge     |
| `ChatController`        | Handles message history, input validation, response matching         |

**Why Provider?**
- Lightweight and widely supported
- Great for local state with no backend dependencies
- Easy testing, modular design, and clear rebuild control

## 🛡 Edge Case Handling – Fully Implemented

All critical edge cases across general, challenge, and chat flows have been addressed:

| Category      | Edge Case                                  | Status |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| General       | No challenges available                     | ✅     |
|               | Very long challenge descriptions            | ✅     |
|               | Button debounce (300ms)                     | ✅     |
| Chat          | 500 character message limit                 | ✅     |
|               | Empty message blocked                       | ✅     |
|               | Rate limiting (3 messages / 15 seconds)     | ✅     |
|               | Duplicate message prevention (5s)           | ✅     |
|               | Keyboard overlap and scroll                 | ✅     |
|               | App background/foreground recovery          | ✅     |
|               | Response variation to avoid repetition      | ✅     |
|               | Fallback for unrecognized inputs            | ✅     |

🧪 **Additional Implementations**
- Smart truncation for long content
- Pull-to-refresh for rotating challenges
- Celebration animations on challenge completion
- Dynamic message input height with color-coded counter
- Auto-scroll on input focus & message sent
- Reusable animated button and filter components

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The app follows **MVU (Model-View-Update)** inspired principles for clarity:

```plaintext
UI Layer (screens/, widgets/)
   ↓
State Controllers (controllers/)
   ↓
Model/Data Layer (models/)
   ↓
Storage/Service Layer (services/, SharedPreferences)

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. Launch the app — go through animated onboarding
2. Accept today’s challenge — observe transition and timer
3. Open chat — test inputs, quick replies, reflection
4. Try edge cases:

   * Long message (500+ chars)
   * Empty message
   * Rapid message taps
   * Duplicate message
   * Background the app and return
5. Try “pull-to-refresh” after midnight (always fetches new challenge)

---

## 🔬 Performance Optimizations

* 🎯 60fps across screens and animations
* ✅ Button debounce: 300ms
* ✅ Efficient ListViews and Chat rendering
* ✅ Chat rate-limit & message deduplication
* ✅ Minimal rebuilds using `Selector`, `Consumer`
* ✅ Shared animation components reused throughout app

## 🔧 Chat Design & Behavior

| Feature                  | Implementation                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Typing Indicator         | Bouncing dots with 1–3s random delay                                     |
| Input Expansion          | Grows smoothly up to 5 lines                                             |
| Character Limit Handling | Counter changes color (green → yellow → red) at thresholds               |
| Quick Reply Chips        | Contextual to current challenge state                                    |
| Hardcoded Responses      | Keyword detection, context-aware, varied responses to prevent repetition |
| Message History          | Persisted locally per challenge/day                                      |
| Fallbacks                | If message unrecognized → default motivational response shown            |
